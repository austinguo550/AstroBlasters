**Concise Description of Your Project:**
	
Our project is a tribute to the legendary classic "Africa" by Toto. The game begins in Africa as a rocket ship takes off carrying refugees off to survival. Few humans stay behind to operate a rotating turret to keep the planet alive for as long as possible from invading asteroids. By clicking the mouse, you launch nuclear bullets towards these asteroids, where the asteroids will explode if the bullet collides with them. On the other hand, if the asteroids collide with the Earth, the Earth explodes. Life begins and ends in Africa, the original motherland for us all.
